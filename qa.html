                  <p><span>This is a type of software testing in which the software component or system is subjected to increasing load in order to study its behavior. By increasing the load - for instance, the number of parallel users or transactions - the study aims to gauge what load can be handled by the software component or system before it breaks down or crashes.</span><br>
                    <span>Load testing helps us find the different bottlenecks in our system and thus mitigate those before actual users face any issue in live application process during a load surge. A typical load-testing tool records the user action using a script recorder and this script is then replayed to test the application by increasing the number of users or changing different parameters browsing the application. Both the hardware and software statistics are monitored and collected by the conductor in replay mode. These statistics include CPU, memory, disk IO of the physical servers and the response time, through the System Under Test (short as SUT), etc. Lastly, all these statistics are analyzed and a load-testing report is generated. This is one sub-category of non-functional type of testing. Some of the popular load testing tools are Load Runner, Apache J-meter, Webload, LoadUI. When the load is increased beyond normal usage patterns, in order to test the system's performance at exceptionally high or peak loads, it is known as stress testing. The load is usually so great that error conditions are the expected results, although no clear boundary exists when an activity ceases to be a load test and becomes a stress test.</span>

            <p><span>API (Application Programming Interface) testing is a type of software testing that aims to determine whether the APIs that are developed meet expectations when it comes to functionality, performance, reliability and security for an application.</span><br>
              <span>API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of procedures and functions that allow interaction between two components of a software application. It accesses the features and data of an operating system, application, or other services. In that sense, an API is essentially a tool for developers to communicate or fetch data with a certain application. API testing is done to check whether the output that comes from the first application/database is correct and well-structured and useful to another application. API testing is used to determine the return value (response). Behaviour of data should be based on input (request) parameter, how much time the API is taking to retrieve the value, what type of authentication is required and whether the sensitive data is transmitted securely over the network.</span>

              <p><span>Fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program. The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, failing built-in code assertions, or potential memory leaks. Typically, fuzzers are used to test programs that take structured inputs. This structure is specified, e.g., in a file format or protocol and distinguishes valid from invalid input. An effective fuzzer generates semi-valid inputs that are "valid enough" in that they are not directly rejected by the parser, but do create unexpected behaviors deeper in the program and are "invalid enough" to expose corner cases that have not been properly dealt with.</span><br>
                <span>For the purpose of security, input that crosses a trust boundary is often the most interesting.For example, it is more important to fuzz code that handles the upload of a file by any user than it is to fuzz the code that parses a configuration file that is accessible only to a privileged user.</span>

            <p><span>SQL injection is an application layer attack technique used by hackers to steal data from organizations by targeting web-based applications.</span><br>
              <span>SQL injection is one of the methods by which hackers attack the underlying data storage of a web application by taking advantage of improper coding styles or insufficient database privileges assigned to the application user who accesses this database. SQL injection arises because user input fields - if not checked correctly at the application - allow SQL statements to pass through and directly question the database, allowing attackers to tamper with or even delete existing data, spoof identity, change administrative rights and in some cases void transactions and change balances. For example, consider a generic login page wherein users can enter their usernames and passwords where they can view their personal details or modify them. Once the user submits the details, an SQL query is generated from these details and sent to the database for verification. If found legitimate, the user is allowed access. Now through SQL injection, the attacker may insert some specifically-crafted SQL commands to bypass the login form and see what lies behind it. Inputs that are not properly sanitized (i.e. made invulnerable) will make this possible and be sent directly with the SQL query to the database, following which the attacker will gain access to the database. Prevalence of older functional interfaces makes PHP and ASP applications common victims of SQL injection attacks. On the other hand, more robust programmatic interfaces make J2EE and ASP.NET applications less likely to get exploited by SQL injection. The severity of SQL injection depends more on the attacker’s skills, imagination and intent. This vulnerability in a system is considered a high impact severity and demands immediate attention.</span>
